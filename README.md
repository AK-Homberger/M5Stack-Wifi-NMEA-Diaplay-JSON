# M5Stack-Wifi-NMEA-Diaplay-JSON
A display for the M5Stack connecting via JSON to the NMEA 2000 WiFi Gateway.

This repository shows hoe to use the JSON Interface of the NMEA 2000 WiFi Gateway to show data on the display.
The include file BoatData.h and the JSON Identifiers shouls be the same as within the Gateway code.

Using JSON as the interface to transfer dat is much easier than to use NME2000 or NMEA0183 protocols for this topic.
